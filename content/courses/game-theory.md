Summary: Game Theory, Graduate course.


The course discusses the fundamentals of game theory. Game theory is the study of mathematical models of strategic interactions among rational agents. It has applications in all fields of social science and logic, economics, systems science, and computer science. Initially, it addresses two-person zero-sum games, in which each participant's gains or losses are exactly balanced by those of other participants. Game theory has recently found many applications in formulating network resource allocation problems and coordinating network entities' behavior to achieve a stable operating point with global consensus property.
