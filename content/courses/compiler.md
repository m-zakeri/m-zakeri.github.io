Summary: Compiler design and constructions, Undergraduate course (Bachelor). 


## Teaching Assistant


### Foreword
I was teaching assistant of Compiler Design and Construction B.Sc. course by Dr. Saeed Parsa for five semesters (more than two years) at Iran University of Science and Technology. Our teaching materials during these two years are available to view and download.

I put all source code that I developed to practically teach compiler  to students on the GitHub page of the IUST compiler course.

## As Student
 always enjoy learning about compilers and their application in software engineering. I firmly believe that the next generation of software engineers are intelligent white-box compilers! Such compilers are structure-aware, context-aware, and domain-aware, assisting the programmer in writing high-quality and testable programs. 
Complier helped artificial intelligence (AI), and now AI boots compiler!
