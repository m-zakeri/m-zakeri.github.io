Welcome to my webpage. I am a Ph.D. student at [Iran University of Science and Technology (IUST)](http://www.iust.ac.ir/en){:target="_blank"}. 
I have got my B.Sc. in computer engineering/ software from Arak University and then received my M.Sc. degree from Iran University of Science and Technology (IUST). In my M.Sc. thesis, I designed and built IUST DeepFuzz , a file format fuzzer which can learn the grammar/structure of file automatically and then generate various test data. In my B.Sc. project, I worked on agent-oriented software engineering and developed a multi-agent system to participate in the multi-agent programming contest (MAPC).

My research interest is about automated software engineering (ASE), especially automated software testing. Currently, I have focused on fuzz testing and test data generation in file format fuzzers. I want to use deep neural networks to statistically capture the format of highly complex file structures and then build a generative model to generate new test data. It seems that there is a straight relationship between well-formed files and percentage of code coverage when Software Under Test (SUT) was executed with such files as input.

Currently, I am a member of IUST Reverse Engineering Research Laboratory and work under the supervision of Dr. Saeed Parsa. You can find and read more information on the laboratory website. As a software engineer, I know about software development methodologies, software architectures, enterprise applications design and development, programming, and computer networks. I am an expert in object-oriented design, database concepts, and ORMs. During the IUST master program, I learned about distributed systems, advanced software engineering, reverse engineering, cluster, grid, and cloud computing, and secure and dependable software systems design.

From summer 2013 my friends and I also maintain Micropedia a free software engineering/ programming tutorials website in Persian. You can find some basic programming tutorials on Micropedia.
