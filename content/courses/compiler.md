Summary: Compiler design and constructions, Undergraduate course (Bachelor). 


## Teaching assistant


### Foreword
I was teaching assistant of Compiler Design and Construction B.Sc. course by [Dr. Saeed Parsa](http://parsa.iust.ac.ir/){:target="_blank"} for seven semesters (more than three years) at Iran University of Science and Technology. Our teaching materials during these three years are available to view and download.

I put all source code that I developed to practically teach compiler  to students on the GitHub page, the [IUST compiler course](http://parsa.iust.ac.ir/courses/compilers/){:target="_blank"}.

### Projects

I designed and planned some **practical** projects about the applications of compiler science in **program analysis**.
The projects shown in Table 1 have been assigned to the students who take the IUST compiler course during different semesters. Click on the link in the "Project" column to see the project proposal.

## As a student

I always enjoy learning about compilers, code transformation, and their application in automated software engineering. I firmly believe that the next generation of software engineers are intelligent white-box compilers! Such compilers are structure-aware, context-aware, and domain-aware, assisting the programmer in writing high-quality and testable programs. 
Compilers helped artificial intelligence (AI) in the past, and now AI boosts compilers!
