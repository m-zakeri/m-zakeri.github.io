Title: About me
Author: Morteza



Welcome to my webpage. I am a first year Ph.D. student at [Iran University of Science and Technology (IUST)](http://www.iust.ac.ir/en){:target="_blank"}. I have got my B.Sc. in computer engineering / *software* from [Arak University](http://en.araku.ac.ir/){:target="_blank"} and then received my M.Sc. degree from [Iran University of Science and Technology (IUST)](http://www.iust.ac.ir/en){:target="_blank"}. 


## Educations
* Ph.D., Computer Engineering, Software; Iran University of Science and Technology (2018 - Now)
* M.Sc., Computer Engineering, Software; Iran University of Science and Technology (2016 - 2018)
* B.Sc., Computer Engineering, Software; Arak University (2011 - 2015)


## Research Interests
My research interests are about automated software engineering (ASE), especially automated software testing. As a new contribution I want to use deep learning techniques in various phases of software testing process. For the time being, I have focused on fuzz testing and test data generation in file format fuzzers. I used deep neural networks (kind of deep learning) to statistically capture the format of highly complex file structures and then built a generative model to generate new test data. It seems that there is a straight relationship between well-formed files and percentage of code coverage when Software Under Test (SUT) was executed with such files as input.


### Theses

#### Master Thesis
In my M.Sc. thesis, I designed and built [IUST-DeepFuzz](https://github.com/m-zakeri/iust_deep_fuzz){:target="_blank"}, a file format fuzzer. IUST-DeepFuzz can learn the grammar (or structure) of file automatically and then generate various test data. You can find all relevant information about my M.Sc. thesis on the [IUST-DeepFuzz GitHub repository](https://github.com/m-zakeri/iust_deep_fuzz){:target="_blank"}. 


#### Bachelor Thesis
In my B.Sc. project, I worked on agent-oriented software engineering and developed a multi-agent system to participate in the [multi-agent programming contest (MAPC)](https://multiagentcontest.org/){:target="_blank"}. Unfortunately, the competitions did not hold in the year 2014, for the technical reasons raised by the new scenario, and our team could not participate in the competitions. 


## Current Position
Currently, I am a member of [IUST Reverse Engineering Research Laboratory](http://parsa.iust.ac.ir/reverse-engineering-lab/){:target="_blank"} and work under the supervision of [Dr. Saeed Parsa](http://parsa.iust.ac.ir){:target="_blank"}. You can find and read more information on the [laboratory website](http://parsa.iust.ac.ir/reverse-engineering-lab/){:target="_blank"}. 


## Skills
As a software engineer, I know about software development methodologies, software architectures, enterprise applications design and development, programming, and computer networks. I am an expert in object-oriented design, database concepts, and ORMs. During the IUST master program, I learned about distributed systems, advanced software engineering, software reverse engineering techniques, cluster, grid, and cloud computing, and secure and dependable software systems design.


## Micropedia
From summer 2013 my friends and I also maintain [Micropedia](http://micropedia.ir/){:target="_blank"} a free software engineering/ programming tutorials website in Persian. You can find some basic programming tutorials on Micropedia.
