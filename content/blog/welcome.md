**L**ife **I**s a **F**ractal **E**vent(Exploration). Create unlimited (infinite) values in limited time!
Hello and welcome to my new personal web-page and blog on GitHub. I am adding more and more information to my blog. I recently heard about [Pelican](http://docs.getpelican.com){:target="_blank"} and decided to switch my blog from pure unstructured HTML to a structured static website. [Pelican](http://docs.getpelican.com){:target="_blank"} is really beautiful blogging and static publishing tool. 
I am new to Pelican, but it is simple and easy to use. I strongly recommend you to use Pelican!
