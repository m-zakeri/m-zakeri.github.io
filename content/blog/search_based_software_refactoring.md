Summary: Finding the best sequence of the refactoring operation to ab applied to a software system is an optimization problem. It can be solved by search techniques in the field known as search-based software engineering (SBSE). In this approach, refactorings are applied stochastically to the original software solution, and then the software is measured using a fitness function consisting of one or more software quality measures. Unfortunately, there is no technical document describing an implementation of decent search-based refactoring. In this tutorial, I am going to explain the implementation of search-based refactoring at the source code level from scratch.


I will back to complete this tutorial soon.
