Summary: Over the past years, I have successfully integrated computer science into a variety of disciplines, including medicine (developing a non-invasive bladder monitoring system and jaundice prediction models), civil engineering (designing bridge management systems, detect attention state of people during exposure to construction noise), materials engineering (applying artificial intelligence to inverse material design), railway engineering (testing an interlocking system), sociology (creating an intelligent mixed research framework), sports (developing a swimming competition management system), and molecular physics (utilizing Raman spectroscopy).
These projects have facilitated a modern approach to interdisciplinary problem-solving known as computational thinking. The most fascinating aspect of this work is how solving a problem in one domain often provides insights to address challenges in entirely different domains. The focus of this effort has been the generalization of solutions to make them applicable to a broad spectrum of problems.

## Bridging Disciplines Through Computational Thinking

Over the past years, I have successfully integrated computer science into a variety of disciplines, showcasing the transformative potential of computational thinking. This interdisciplinary approach has yielded significant contributions in multiple fields: medicine (developing a non-invasive bladder monitoring system and jaundice prediction models), civil engineering (designing bridge management systems), materials engineering (applying artificial intelligence to inverse material design), railway engineering (testing an interlocking system), sociology (creating an intelligent mixed research framework), sports (developing a swimming competition management system), and molecular physics (utilizing Raman spectroscopy).

Each of these projects exemplifies the power of computational thinking in solving complex, real-world challenges. By abstracting and generalizing solutions, I have not only addressed specific problems within individual domains but also developed methods that can be applied to entirely different fields. This work demonstrates the universality of computational principles and their capacity to drive innovation across disciplines.

### Expanding the Horizons of Computational Thinking

The interdisciplinary nature of computational thinking has opened new avenues for exploration. For instance:
- **Healthcare and AI Integration**: Leveraging machine learning for early disease detection, personalized treatments, and non-invasive diagnostic tools.
- **Environmental Engineering**: Employing computational models to analyze climate patterns, optimize renewable energy systems, and develop sustainable urban planning solutions.
- **Education**: Designing intelligent tutoring systems that adapt to individual student needs and incorporating computational thinking into curricula to foster problem-solving skills across all disciplines.
- **Arts and Humanities**: Utilizing computational methods to analyze literary texts, reconstruct historical artifacts, and create generative art.
- **Ethics and Policy**: Developing frameworks to ensure the ethical application of computational technologies and addressing societal implications of automation and AI.

### Future Works in Interdisciplinary Computational Thinking

Moving forward, several promising areas warrant further research and development:
1. **Adaptive Generalization of Solutions**: Refining computational models to ensure their adaptability to diverse and evolving problems across disciplines.
2. **Cross-Domain Knowledge Transfer**: Investigating methodologies for systematically transferring insights and solutions between domains to foster more efficient and innovative problem-solving.
3. **Human-Centric Design in Computational Tools**: Focusing on usability and accessibility to ensure that computational solutions are approachable and effective for experts in non-technical fields.
4. **Collaboration Platforms for Interdisciplinary Research**: Building digital ecosystems that connect researchers from different fields, facilitating collaboration, knowledge sharing, and integrated solution development.
5. **Addressing Socio-Technical Challenges**: Exploring computational approaches to complex societal challenges, such as public health crises, environmental sustainability, and social equity.

### Remark

The interdisciplinary application of computational thinking has not only enhanced my ability to solve problems in diverse fields but has also deepened my understanding of the interconnectedness of knowledge. Each endeavor has been an opportunity to transcend traditional boundaries, fostering innovation that benefits both specialized fields and society at large.

The evolving landscape of computational thinking continues to offer untapped potential for bridging gaps between disciplines. By embracing this modern approach, we can address increasingly complex challenges in a way that leverages the strengths of diverse fields and creates solutions that are both robust and adaptable.
