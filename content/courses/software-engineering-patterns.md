Summary: Patterns and Principles in Software Engineering, graduate course.


## Course Description
This course explores the foundational principles and design patterns that underpin modern software engineering. It aims to equip students with a deep understanding of reusable solutions, architectural patterns, and best practices to enhance the quality, maintainability, and scalability of software systems. Through a mix of theoretical concepts and practical applications, students will learn how to apply these principles effectively in real-world scenarios.

## Course Objectives
By the end of this course, students will:
1. Understand core software design principles such as SOLID, DRY, and KISS.

2. Analyze and apply common software design patterns including Creational, Structural, and Behavioral patterns.

3. Develop skills to architect scalable and maintainable software systems.

4. Explore principles of software evolution, refactoring, and maintainability.

5. Gain insights into modern software development practices, including agile development and DevOps principles.
