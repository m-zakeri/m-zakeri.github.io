Title: About Me
Author: Morteza



I am a first year Ph.D. student at [Iran University of Science and Technology (IUST)](http://www.iust.ac.ir/en){:target="_blank"}. I have got my B.Sc. in computer engineering / *software* from [Arak University](http://en.araku.ac.ir/){:target="_blank"} and then received my M.Sc. degree from [Iran University of Science and Technology (IUST)](http://www.iust.ac.ir/en){:target="_blank"}. 

## Research Interests
My research interests are about empirical and automated software engineering (ASE), especially automated software testing, test data generation, dynamic software analysis and applying machine learning in software engineering.  As a new contribution I want to use deep learning techniques in various phases of software testing process include test data generation, fault localization and program repair. For the time being, I have focused on fuzz testing and test data generation in file format fuzzers. I used deep neural networks (kind of deep learning techniques) to statistically capture the format of highly complex file structures and then built a generative model to generate new test data. It seems that there is a straight relationship between well-formed files and percentage of code coverage when Software Under Test (SUT) was executed with such files as input.

## Current Position
Currently, I am a member of [IUST Reverse Engineering Research Laboratory](http://parsa.iust.ac.ir/reverse-engineering-lab/){:target="_blank"} and work under the supervision of [Dr. Saeed Parsa](http://parsa.iust.ac.ir){:target="_blank"}. You can find and read more information on the official [laboratory website](http://parsa.iust.ac.ir/reverse-engineering-lab/){:target="_blank"}.

## Theses

### Ph.D. Dissertation
Hmm... It is on the way!

### Master Thesis
In my M.Sc. thesis, I designed and built _IUST-DeepFuzz_, a file format fuzzer and provide IUST-PDFCorpus, a large dataset of PDF files and PDF data objects. IUST-DeepFuzz can automatically learn the grammar (structure) of a given input file, then generate and fuzz various test data based on the learned model and some mutation-based methods. You can find all relevant information about my M.Sc. thesis on the [IUST-DeepFuzz GitHub repository](https://github.com/m-zakeri/iust_deep_fuzz){:target="_blank"}.

* Download my M.Sc Seminar Report (Will be added soon)


### Bachelor Project
In my B.Sc. project, I worked on agent-oriented software engineering and developed a multi-agent system to participate in the [multi-agent programming contest (MAPC)](https://multiagentcontest.org/){:target="_blank"}. Unfortunately, the competitions did not hold in the year 2014, for the technical reasons raised by the new scenario, and our team could not participate in the competitions.

## Skills
As a software engineer, I know about software development methodologies (both traditional and modern methodologies), software architectures, enterprise applications design and development, programming, and computer networks. I am an expert in object-oriented design, database concepts, and ORMs. During the IUST master program, I learned about distributed systems, advanced software engineering, software reverse engineering techniques, cluster, grid, and cloud computing, and secure and dependable software systems design.


## Micropedia
From summer 2013 my friends and I also maintain [Micropedia](http://micropedia.ir/){:target="_blank"} a free software engineering/ programming tutorials website in Persian. You can find some basic programming tutorials on Micropedia.
